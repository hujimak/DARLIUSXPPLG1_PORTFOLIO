                <h3 class="scrinfo">I made this scratch game before the beginning of the odd semester exam or what is called PTS/UTS. And making this scratch game took less than 2 days to complete. The scratch game that I took has a theme about a man who rides a boat while avoiding random rocks and his task is to collect as many random coins as possible.</h3>
